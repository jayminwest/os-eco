{"type":"reference","name":"CLI framework audit","description":"CLI framework audit (Feb 2025): Mulch uses Commander v14 + chalk (reference implementation). Seeds, Canopy, Overstory all use custom manual argv parsing with switch statements and local getFlag/hasFlag helpers. All use raw ANSI codes for colors except Mulch which uses chalk. All support --json globally. All store data as JSONL with advisory file locks and atomic writes.","classification":"tactical","recorded_at":"2026-02-24T03:26:40.633Z","tags":["cli","audit","framework"],"id":"mx-db7fc1"}
{"type":"reference","name":"CLI command overlap map","description":"Shared commands across tools: sync (all 4), prime (all 4), doctor (mulch/seeds/overstory), onboard (mulch/seeds/canopy), status/stats (mulch=status, seeds=stats, overstory=status, canopy=stats). All have --json on every command. Seeds/Canopy/Overstory run TypeScript directly via Bun (no build step). Mulch compiles to dist/ via tsc (Node/npm). Overstory is the only tool with shell completions (bash/zsh/fish).","classification":"tactical","recorded_at":"2026-02-24T03:26:42.352Z","tags":["cli","audit","commands"],"id":"mx-9181f9"}
{"type":"reference","name":"CLI output and error patterns","description":"Mulch uses chalk.green for success (✔), chalk.red for errors, process.exitCode=1 (testability). Seeds uses raw ANSI with status icons, process.exit(1). Canopy uses raw ANSI with ExitError class, process.exit(1). Overstory has richest error system (OverstoryError hierarchy with codes: CONFIG_ERROR, AGENT_ERROR, etc.), uses process.exit(1). JSON error shape is { success: false, command, error } in Seeds/Mulch; Overstory adds error code field.","classification":"tactical","recorded_at":"2026-02-24T03:26:44.187Z","tags":["cli","audit","output","errors"],"id":"mx-88991a"}
{"type":"decision","title":"CLI alignment strategy","rationale":"Mulch is the reference implementation for CLI UX. All tools will adopt Commander for parsing and chalk for output. Seeds and Canopy get big-bang rewrites of CLI layer (business logic untouched). Overstory gets incremental migration due to its 30+ commands. No shared library — each tool is standalone; they just follow the same conventions.
